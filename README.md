# Nowcasting German GDP with text data

## Overview

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper "Nowcasting German GDP with Text Data" by Mariia Okuneva, Philipp Hauber, Kai Carstensen, and Jasper Bär. The repository provides detailed Jupyter notebooks that document the pre-processing steps applied to a dataset of articles from Handelsblatt, Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), Welt, and Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa).

Each folder within the repository corresponds to a specific source and includes a dedicated notebook that outlines the step-by-step pre-processing steps performed on that source's data. The specifics of each pre-processing step are detailed in the appendix of the paper, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
